# FriendFinder-app
Homework Assignment #10
1. As soon as the user lands on my FriendFinder app, they are prompted to go straight to the survey.
2. Once on the survery, the user needs to input their name into the empty field and also a url link to their photo in the next empty field.  
3. After filling out that information, the user is prompted to answer 10 different questions about their likes and dislikes.
4. After submitting the completed survey, my app takes the user's survery scores and then compares them to 5 other friends who answered the exact same questions. 
5. Upon completion of comparing the scores, my app will then populate the photo of the friend who's survey scores are closest to the users and then BAM, the user has found a new friend who is just like them :)
